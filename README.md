# Week-5-Day-1

Challenge
------

Using [names.txt](names.txt), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

1. Read and complete the SQL Course at http://www.sqlcourse.com. You should be comfortable creating tables, inserting records, finding records, updating records, and deleting records
1. Create a SQL script (in a gist) that accomplishes the following:

* Creates a table for "cities" with the following information.

```
Place name    2013 Estimate   2010 Census   Change
Houston       2,195,914       2,100,263     4.55%
San Antonio   1,409,019       1,327,407     6.15%
Dallas        1,257,676       1,197,816     5.00%
Austin        885,400         790,390       12.02%
Fort Worth    792,727         741,206       6.95%
```

* Insert data for each row
* Write a SQL Statement which will find all records (with all fields) in the
  table
* Write a SQL Statement which will find the city with the largest population
